	<h2>April 13, 2014 | Inline vs. Block Elements</h2>
	<h3>One time a p tag and a span tag were waiting to checkout at the grocery store. The p tag seemed to be in a giant hurry, and tried to cut the span tag. The span tag said: "No cutting, get inline!" to which the p tag responded: "stop it! You can't block me!"</h3>

	Okay all lame jokes aside, today's blog is all about the difference between inline and block elements. <a href = "http://www.htmlhelp.com/reference/html40/inline.html">Some elements</a> are inline - they naturaly integrate themselves with the elements around them, where as <a href = "http://www.htmlhelp.com/reference/html40/block.html">others</a> are block elements, they are separated out from the other items on the page nearby.
