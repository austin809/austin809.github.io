My three favorite websites are ESPN, Reddit, and Facebook.

<ul><li><a href = "www.ESPN.go.com">ESPN</a><br><br>ESPN is undoubtedly one of my favorite sites because it feeds my insatiable need to be constantly up to date with my favorite sports teams. There are several more obscure sports that I follow that ESPN covers, and for that, they have a monopoly over my sport-related web-surfing. Unfortunately, their GUI is lacking. They've had the same boring and brutal format for as long as I can remember. They also often host large ads that cover the entire website, requiring you to scroll down significantly to find the elusive exit box. Words I'd associate with it? Accelerated, data -driven, pictures, categorized.<br><br></li><li><a href = "www.reddit.com">Reddit</a><br><br>Reddit is the site that sucks up far too much of my time. It easily feeds into my short attention span. What better way to pass time on the train to work or falling asleep in bed than by looking at pictures of cute kittehs, semi-humorous images with text laid over them, and glossing over the extremely opiniated views of those who comment in the politics subreddit? One of the issues most frequently complained about in regards to this site is it's lackluster search function. For example, when I want to reference a previous post from a few months back, it's unlikely I'll be able to find it unless I've already saved it. Associated words: captivating, low-energy, cats, universal-appeal <br><br></li><li><a href = "www.facebook.com">Facebook</a><br><br>This one is a gimme. Want to stay in touch with your friends over a broad spectrum of mediums? Want to make your ex jealous by posting pictures of you and that one girl you're kind of sort of dating? Want to stalk your old high school classmates new baby pictures? Well then facebook is for you. I enjoy facebook as a consumer greatly. It alows me to stay in touch with acquaintances, let the world know what I'm thinking about at any given time (vital), and look at pictures of my dogs (super vital). Words: social, attention-seeking, vain, time-consuming.<br><br></li></ul>
