<h1>Hello DBC!<br>My name is Austin</h1>
Welcome to my website! My name is Austin, and over the course of the next several months I will be attending Dev Bootcamp, with the end goal of pursuing a career in web design. As a relative novice to the field, this will likely become more specific as I come to understand the industry.

	<h1>Welcome to my blog!</h1>

	<h2>April 13, 2014 | Inline vs. Block Elements</h2>
	<h3>One time a p tag and a span tag were waiting to checkout at the grocery store. The p tag seemed to be in a giant hurry, and tried to cut the span tag. The span tag said: "No cutting, get inline!" to which the p tag responded: "stop it! You can't block me!"</h3>

	<p>
	Okay, painfully lame jokes aside, today's blog is all about the difference between inline and block elements. <a href = "http://www.htmlhelp.com/reference/html40/inline.html">Some elements</a> are inline - they naturaly integrate themselves with the elements around them, while <a href = "http://www.htmlhelp.com/reference/html40/block.html">others</a> are block elements -  they are separated out from the other items on the page nearby.

	<h2>April 20, 2014 | The Rise of Javascript On the Internet</h2>
	<h3>This week I'm looking deeper into why Javascript has rose to such prominence and importance in the web development world
	</h3>

	<p><em>1. It's efficient and powerful!</em> It's not necessary for data to be pulled from a server for Javascript to be run, like standard HTML and CSS requires. Running this standard programming language is as simple as refreshing the web page you're on.</p>
	<p><em>2. It's an object oriented language!</em> Because of this, we developers can manipulate it to access the individual HTML objects (tags) on a page. As I continue to use javascript going forward, and having a decent amount of back-end programming experience, I can see how this could become incredibly powerful.
	</p>
	<p><em>3. It's popularity and ubiquity</em> means that you're highly unlikely to run across browser that does not support its functionailty.</p>

	<h2>April 24, 2014 | The Map Method</h2>
	<h3>A look into it's use and syntax!</h3>

	<p><em>The map method is, like most everything in Ruby, designed to simplify an otherwise lengthy program into a flexible and efficient tool.</em> When used correctly and on the appropriate object class, the map method returns the result of performing a specified function across all items within a given object. The method is enherently <em>non-destructive</em>, meaning it does not alter the original object passed to it. However, its "bang method" twin ("map!") is destructive, meaning that not only does calling map on a object return the result of mapping the object, but it also reassigns the value of that object.</p>
	<p><em>Syntax.</em> Map Method syntax is <em>really</em> straightforward:</p>

	<div id = "map_syntax">object.map{|x| x**2}<br>
	<p>This is a basic structure of the map method. An array or hash object is passed to map, which applies the given function (in this case x-squared) upon each item stored within it. It then returns an array containing the newly-created values.</p>
	<p>For example:</p>
	<p>>>  [1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10].map{|x| x**2}<br>
	=>  [1,4,9,16,25,36,49,64,81,100]
	</p>
