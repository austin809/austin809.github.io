<li>Discuss a time you had an emotional conflict with someone. What was it about? What happened?</li>

<p>There was a time where the outside of my college fraternity's walkway was graffitied. In my anger, I lashed out a few people who I suspected were involved over e-mail...to our entire listserve.</p>

<li>What was the source of the conflict?</li>

<p>Sort of self-explanatory, but the conflict was my anger over the destrcution of the walkway.

<li>How did you handle that conflict?</li>

<p>Quite poorly, actually. Like I mentioned above, I e-mailed my complaints to a 70 person listserve.</p>
<li>Did your actions make the conflict better or worse?</li>

<p>My actions definitely exacerbated the situtation. I only created more anger, and did nothing to difuse the situation.</p>

<li>If you could go back, what would you do differently, if anything?</li>

<p>Absolutely, I would not ever do something so rash and unsensitive again. I've learned my lesson.

<li>What did you learn from this experience?</li>

<p>Don't be so rash, and definitely think before I rush to judgment. At the end of the day, the people who I believed were guilty were not at all, and I looked like the bad guy.</p>
