<body><center><h1>Hello DBC!</h1><br>

<header>Welcome to my website! My name is Austin, and over the course of the next several months I will be attending Dev Bootcamp, with the end goal of pursuing a career in web design. As a relative novice to the field, this will likely become more specific as I come to understand the industry. This site is meant as a repositiory for my project files, as well as a blog tracking my experience. This site will evolve as I travel down the DBC path. Thanks for visiting!
