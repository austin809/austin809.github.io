	<h2>April 13, 2014 | Inline vs. Block Elements</h2>
	<h3>One time a p tag and a span tag were waiting to checkout at the grocery store. The p tag seemed to be in a giant hurry, and tried to cut the span tag. The span tag said: "No cutting, get inline!" to which the p tag responded: "stop it! You can't block me!"</h3>

	<p>
	Okay all lame jokes aside, today's blog is all about the difference between inline and block elements. <a href = "http://www.htmlhelp.com/reference/html40/inline.html">Some elements</a> are inline - they naturaly integrate themselves with the elements around them, where as <a href = "http://www.htmlhelp.com/reference/html40/block.html">others</a> are block elements, they are separated out from the other items on the page nearby.

	<h2>April 20, 2014 | The Rise of Javascript On the Internet</h2>
	<h3>This week I'm looking deeper into why Javascript has rose to such prominence and importance in the web development world</h3>

	<p><em>1. It's efficient, and powerful!</em> It's not necessary for data to be pulled from a server for Javascript to be run, like standard HTML and CSS requires. Running this standard programming language is as simple as refreshing the web page you're on.</p>
	<p><em>2. It's an object oriented language!</em> Because of this, we developers can manipulate it to access the individual HTML objects (tags) on a page. As I continue to use javascript going forward, and having a decent amount of back-end programming experience, I can see how this could become incredibly powerful.
	</p>
	<p><em>3. It's popularity and ubiquity</em> means that you're highly unlikely to run across browser that does not support its functionailty.</p>
