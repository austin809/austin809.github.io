My three favorite websites are ESPN, Reddit, and Facebook.

<ul><li><a href = "http://www.ESPN.go.com">ESPN</a><br><br>This website is not so much solivng a problem as it is providing a convenient all-in-one place to find scores for a variety of sports. The most obvious visual challenge is making the home page attractive to people without dumping tons of numbers on them as they first visit the page. This is at least partly combatted by using images, articles, and video highlights.<br><br><a href="http://s23.postimg.org/74eslob2j/ESPN.jpg"><img src="http://s23.postimg.org/74eslob2j/ESPN.jpg"></a></li><li><a href = "http://www.reddit.com">Reddit</a><br><br>Reddit too seeks not to solve a problem but to provide a service. I would suggest that the biggest problem it faces it getting everything organized into a meaningful useful way for each user. This is achieved through subreddits, which allow each user to customize his or her experience on the site.<br><br><a href="http://s18.postimg.org/dq6hwgxll/reddit.jpg"><img src="http://s18.postimg.org/dq6hwgxll/reddit.jpg"></a></li><li><a href = "http://www.facebook.com">Facebook</a><br><br>Facebook provides hyperactive social connection. My dividing the page up into appealing sections, it allows users to focus on different parts of the site.<br><br><a href="http://s16.postimg.org/w1i9dor2t/facebook.jpg"><img src="http://s16.postimg.org/w1i9dor2t/facebook.jpg"></a></li></ul>
